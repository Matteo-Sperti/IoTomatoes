# IoTomatoes

IoT project for smart-agriculture.
IoTomatoes allows support to farmers and agri-service providers in order to increase productivity, optimize use of water and light, reducing the impact on the environment.

The proposed IoT platform integrates different IoT devices in order to provide a suitable control strategy and data analysis for agricultural holdings management and grow different types of crops. It also guarantees standardized communication interfaces (REST and MQTT) to easily communicate with pre-existing sensors.

The main features provided by the platform will be:
- Consumption management;
- Machineries geolocalization;
- Irrigation and lighting control;
- Environment and soil data analysis;
- Unified interfaces (REST Web Services and MQTT);
- End-usersâ€™ maintenance and awareness.

# Installation

The required packages to run the IoT platform are:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.dev/)
- [paho-mqtt](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/index.php?page=clients/python/index.php)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
- [pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [gpxpy](https://pypi.org/project/gpxpy/)
- [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)

Moreover it is suggested to install the IoT support package [IoTomatoes_SupportPackage](./IoTomatoes_SupportPackage/README.md) that contains some useful functions to simplify the development of the IoT devices.

    python -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ IoTomatoes_SupportPackage --no-deps
