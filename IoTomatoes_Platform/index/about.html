			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The proposed IoT platform for Smart Farming is built on the base of the microservices design pattern. It will basically exploit 2 types of communication paradigms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE:</strong> based on the usage of the MQTT protocol;</li>
				<li><strong>REQUEST/RESPONSE:</strong> based on REST Web Services.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Components</h2>
			<h3>Launcher</h3>
			<p>The <a href="./docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a> file is a script that allows to build and run all the microservices of the IoT platform in a single
            command. It is based on the Docker Compose tool, which is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The docker-compose.yml file is a YAML file that defines the services that make up the application as well as the configuration needed to run each service.</p>
            <h3>Microservices</h3>
            <p>The IoT platform is composed of 4 microservices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IoT Gateway:</strong> it is the main component of the IoT platform. It is responsible for the communication with the IoT devices and the communication with the other microservices of the platform. It is based on the Mosquitto MQTT broker.</li>
                <li><strong>IoT Data Manager:</strong> it is responsible for the management of the data collected by the IoT devices. It is based on the Mosquitto MQTT broker.</li>
                <li><strong>IoT Data Analyzer:</strong> it is responsible for the analysis of the data collected by the IoT devices. It is based on the Mosquitto MQTT broker.</li>
                <li><strong>IoT Data Visualizer:</strong> it is responsible for the visualization of the data collected by the IoT devices. It is based on the Mosquitto MQTT broker.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>IoT Devices</h3>
            <p>The IoT platform is able to communicate with different types of IoT devices. In particular, it is able to communicate with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arduino:</strong> it is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. It is able to communicate with the IoT platform through the MQTT protocol.</li>
                <li><strong>ESP8266:</strong> it is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability produced by Espressif Systems. It is able to communicate with the IoT platform through the MQTT protocol.</li>
                <li><strong>ESP32:</strong> it is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. It is able to communicate with the IoT platform through the MQTT protocol.</li>
                <li><strong>Raspberry Pi:</strong> it is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. It is able to communicate with the IoT platform through the MQTT protocol.</li>
            </ul>
