# IoTomatoes

IoT project for smart-agriculture.
IoTomatoes provides support to agri-service providers in order to enhance productivity, 
optimize power consumption, and minimize environmental impact.

The proposed IoT platform integrates different IoT devices in order to provide a suitable control strategy and data analysis for agricultural holdings management and grow different types of crops. It also guarantees standardized communication interfaces (REST and MQTT) to easily communicate with pre-existing sensors.

The main features provided by the platform will be:
- Power consumption management;
- Machineries geolocalization;
- Irrigation and lighting control;
- Environment and soil data analysis;
- Unified interfaces (REST Web Services and MQTT);
- End-usersâ€™ maintenance and awareness.

# Installation

The required packages to run the IoT platform are:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.dev/)
- [paho-mqtt](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/index.php?page=clients/python/index.php)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [gpxpy](https://pypi.org/project/gpxpy/)
- [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)

Moreover it is suggested to install the support package [IoTomatoes_SupportPackage](./IoTomatoes_SupportPackage/README.md) that contains some useful functions to simplify the development of the IoT devices on your host PC.

    python -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ IoTomatoes_SupportPackage --no-deps
